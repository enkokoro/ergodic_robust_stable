Basic Functionality
[O] fourier_function package
    calculates fourier basis functions (torch and casadi versions), mu_k
[O] probability distribution function package
[O] generic agent package
    [O] system visualization

Agent Controls
[testing] mm_agent order 1 package 
[ ] casadi control

System Communication Methods
[not yet tested] global communication system 
[ ] local communication system
[ ] optimal communication system 

[ ] generic ergodic coverage run package, casadi control

Perturbation
[O] perturbation package
[ ] run perturbation tests (agent belief <- compute control vs actual <- compute ergodicity)

Optional
[ ] animation package
